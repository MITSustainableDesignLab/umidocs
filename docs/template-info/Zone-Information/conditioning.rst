.. index:: Heating
.. _cond_heating:

Heating
```````

.. index:: Heating setpoint
.. _cond_h_setpoint:

Heating setpoint
````````````````

The temperature below which zone heating is turned on.

.. index:: Heating schedule
.. _cond_h_schedule:

Heating schedule
````````````````

Schedule for when the heating system is available. Winter only enables the heating system when the outdoor temperature is less than 5 °C.

.. index:: Max heat flow
.. _cond_h_max_flow:

Max heat flow
`````````````

.. index:: Heating CoP
.. _cond_h_cop:

Heating CoP
```````````

Efficiency of heating system. This value is used in deriving total heating energy use by dividing the heating load by the heating efficiency.

.. index:: Cooling
.. _cond_cooling:

Cooling
```````

.. index:: Cooling setpoint
.. _cond_c_setpoint:

Cooling setpoint
````````````````

.. index:: Cooling schedule
.. _cond_c_schedule:

Cooling schedule
````````````````

Schedule for when the cooling system is available. Summer only enables the cooling system when the outdoor temperature is greater than 8 °C below the cooling setpoint.

Max cool flow
`````````````

.. index:: Cooling CoP
.. _cond_c_cop:

Cooling CoP
```````````

Performance factor of cooling system. This value is used in deriving the total cooling energy use by dividing the cooling load by the COP.

.. index:: Mechanical ventilation
