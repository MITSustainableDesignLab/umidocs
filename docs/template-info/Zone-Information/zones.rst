.. index:: Dayligth Mesh Resolution
.. _thisDaylightMeshRes:

Dayligth Mesh Resolution
````````````````````````

Defines the :index:`Dayligth Mesh Resolution`. To use a finer mesh resolution when running any a daylighting simulation, adjust the “Geometric Density” option. Values are in meters. A fine mesh resolution will show a spacial distribution of daylighting better than a coarse one, but will take longer to calculate.

.. index:: Dayligth Workplane Height
.. _thisDaylightWorkHeight:

Dayligth Workplane Height
`````````````````````````

The distance of sampling nodes off of analysis surfaces. A value of 0.8 m will put the sensor nodes roughly at desk height.
