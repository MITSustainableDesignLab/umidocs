## Getting Started

These instructions cover running this project *locally* on both macOS and Windows so that you can preview changes before pushing them to ReadTheDocs.

First, using the command line, navigate somewhere safe and clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/MITSustainableDesignLab/umidocs.git
```

If you are not comfortable using git on the command-line, then try [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) and [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/). There's also the [git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

The `master` branch represents the Official version of the site.  Changes to the `master` branch will be built by ReadTheDocs.org and deployed to http://umidocs.readthedocs.io.

The `develop` branch is the WIP (Work In Progress) version of the site. It will also be built by ReadTheDocs and deployed to http://umidocs.readthedocs.io/en/develop/. Use this branch to test out your changes before submitting a Pull Request to the `master` branch.
